## Project Tasks:

1. Preparing our dataset
2. Pairwise relationships between continuous variables
3. Normalizing the feature data
4. Principal Component Analysis on our scaled data
5. Further visualization of PCA
6. Train a decision tree to classify genre
7. Compare our decision tree to a logistic regression
8. Balance our data for greater performance
9. Does balancing our dataset improve model bias?
10. Using cross-validation to evaluate our models
